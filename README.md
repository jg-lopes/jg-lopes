### Learning Goals

#### Familiarize myself with Go with some small projects

I've noticed that I'm doing too much Python for the past couple of years. I'm also now super into distributed systems (always was, just am now even more!).

I have no idea why I haven't even tried to learn Go before. Time to fix this mistake!

#### Brush up on some old friends

Been quite a while since I don't touch C++ and JavaScript (esp. TS). I'm also working on some small projects to refresh my skills on them - one does not improve in C++ just by glancing at TensorFlow source code.
